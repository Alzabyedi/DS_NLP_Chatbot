# NLP on Amazon comment reviews
The goal of this project is to use topic modeling on amazon comment reviews and select the most written topics in the comment , also delete columns that contain numeric or URL link and have only one text column for applying Unsupervised learning in Natural-language-processing. We cleaned text and preprocessing steps starting 
with creating our stop word then have used the following topic modeling techniques:

 +	LSA and Count Vectorization/TF
 +	NMF and Count Vectorization/TF
 +	LDA and Count Vectorization/TF
